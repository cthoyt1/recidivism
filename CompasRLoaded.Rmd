```{r}
library(RSQLite)
setwd("~/Statistics/STAT 656/Project/Task 2")
filename <- "compas.db"
sqlite.driver <- dbDriver("SQLite")
db <- dbConnect(sqlite.driver,
                dbname = filename)
                
## Some operations
dbListTables(db)
caseArrest <- dbReadTable(db,"casearrest")
charge <- dbReadTable(db,"charge")
compas <- dbReadTable(db,"compas")
jailHistory <- dbReadTable(db,"jailHistory")
people <- dbReadTable(db,"people")
prisonHistory <- dbReadTable(db,"prisonhistory")
summaryCompas <- dbReadTable(db,"summary")
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
